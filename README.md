## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I learned a lot in this project. The HTML and CSS were pretty solid but this project REALLY had me study JavaScript. I learned about functions and math operations. and how to target specific classes to get things to work.

### Continued development

Learning how to use Javascript more. I had to do a LOT of research and I am only a little confident in my JavaScript abilities.
